     <h1>Quick Background/Why</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-border">
          My Girlfriend and I are avid travelers. We always talk about traveling to different locations 
          <br>with the hope of creating memories and experiences. So I am making this <br>website as plan and guide for us 
          and practicing my website development skills.

        <p>Instead of putting our faces on the front page I decided to make some art to represent us!</p>
